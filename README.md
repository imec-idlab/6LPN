6TiSCH Low-Power Node

This repository will contain the open-source code of an ultra-low-power node for 6TiSCH networks, presented in the paper "Supporting Ultra-Low-Power Nodes in 6TiSCH Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks". As the paper is currently under review, the open-source code will be made available after publication.
